# Google Calendar Integration

This repository contains code that integrates with Google Calendar, allowing users to manage their events programmatically. The integration is built using Python and leverages the Google Calendar API to perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting events.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Programmatically create events in Google Calendar with specific details like title, date, time, location, and description.
- **Event Retrieval**: Fetch upcoming events from your Google Calendar to display or process them within your application.
- **Event Updating**: Modify existing events by updating their details based on user input.
- **Event Deletion**: Delete events from Google Calendar using their unique event IDs.
- **Authentication**: Securely authenticate users using OAuth 2.0 to access their Google Calendar data.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.x**: The code is written in Python, so make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Google Cloud Project**: You need to create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the Google Calendar API.
3. **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**: Download the `credentials.json` file from your Google Cloud project and place it in the root directory of this repository.
4. **Required Python Packages**: Install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreya-yadav/google-calendar-integration.git
   cd google-calendar-integration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Place `credentials.json`**:

   The credentials file shall be downloded from the service account of your own as it contains the provate key.


## Usage

### Authentication

The first time you run the script, it will prompt you to authenticate with your Google account. After authentication, an access token will be saved in a `token.json` file, allowing subsequent runs without re-authentication.

### Creating an Event

You can create a new event by calling the `create_event` function, passing in the necessary event details.

### Updating an Event

To update an existing event, retrieve the event ID and pass it to the `update_event` function with the updated details.

### Deleting an Event

To delete an event, pass the event ID to the `delete_event` function.
